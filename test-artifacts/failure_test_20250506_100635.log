Starting Failure Simulation Test...
This test is designed to trigger a 500 error and properly report it.
Verifying mock Calendar API is available...
Mock API test endpoint response: {
  status: 'success',
  message: 'Mock Calendar API is working',
  timestamp: '2025-05-06T10:06:39.105Z'
}
Triggering intentional server error...
✅ Successfully received expected 500 error from mock API
Error details: {
  error: { code: 500, message: 'Internal server error', errors: [ [Object] ] }
}
❌ TEST FAILED AS EXPECTED - This is good for validation purposes
✅ Failure test correctly failed with exit code 1
This is the expected behavior and validates our error detection
🧪 Cleaning up...
