Spec: SyncFit Intelligent Scheduling & Learning Mode
🧠 Purpose

Enable SyncFit to suggest workout times that reflect user habits — not just free space — while giving users clear, respectful control via a Learning Mode toggle.

This system passively learns from user behaviour and subtly enhances slot recommendations without adding cognitive load.
🔄 Feature Overview
🧠 Learning Mode Toggle

A user-facing toggle that controls whether SyncFit:

    Tracks usage patterns (slotStats)

    Applies smart scoring to rank time slots

🤖 Intelligent Scheduling Engine

Ranks available time slots based on:

    Historical preference (slotStats)

    Meeting adjacency (fatigue risk)

    Time-of-day and weekday behaviour patterns

⚙️ System Components
🔧 1. Firestore: users/{userId}/preferences

{
  "learningEnabled": true,
  "lastLearningChange": "2025-05-05T21:00:00Z"
}

Used to toggle learning mode logic in the client and optionally in backend logic.
📊 2. Firestore: users/{userId}/slotStats/{slotId}

{
  "slotId": "tue_07",
  "totalScheduled": 3,
  "totalCancelled": 1,
  "successRate": 0.75,
  "lastUsed": "2025-05-02T07:00:00Z"
}

Used to:

    Score slots during suggestion logic

    Show optional learning summaries later

🧮 3. Slot Scoring Utility (scoreSlot())

Input:

    slotId (e.g. thu_18)

    slotStats (from Firestore)

    hasAdjacentMeetings (boolean)

Output:

    Integer score (higher = more preferred)

score = (scheduledCount) + (successRate * 5) - (adjacentMeetings ? 2 : 0) - (cancelled > 2 ? 3 : 0)

📋 4. Learning Mode Toggle UI

Location:

    Settings screen

Toggle:

    Learning Mode
    “Let SyncFit learn your preferred times to suggest better workouts.”

Options:

    ON (default)

    OFF

📥 5. When to Write to slotStats

Only write when:

    preferences.learningEnabled === true

    A workout is created or deleted

    Use the slot's slotId (e.g. mon_07) as key

📤 6. When to Use Intelligent Suggestions

Use slotStats + scoreSlot() to rank suggestions only when:

    preferences.learningEnabled === true

    The user is requesting slot suggestions

Else:

    Show unranked availability

✅ User-Facing Behaviour Summary
State	Behaviour
Learning ON	SyncFit ranks slots, shows ⭐ recommendations, and updates slotStats
Learning OFF	SyncFit shows only available slots, no ranking or pattern tracking
Toggle change	Resets sync logic instantly; no stored data is deleted automatically
Future plan (opt-in)	Add "Clear Learning History" if needed

Toggle Label

    Learning Mode

Slot UI

    ⭐ Recommended
    Based on your recent habits.

🔐 Security / Privacy Considerations

    Do not write slotStats if learningEnabled === false

    Do not expose other users' slotStats data

    SlotStats are local to the user and not shared across accounts/devices unless authenticated

🧪 Testing Plan
Scenario	What to Validate
Learning toggle ON	slotStats written, slots ranked
Learning toggle OFF	no writes to slotStats, raw slots shown
Toggle toggled rapidly	Does not break slot fetching or cause duplicate events
Retry logic respects Learning	Retry events update slotStats only if learning is enabled
