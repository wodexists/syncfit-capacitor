The latest screenshots show that we're finally connected to Google Calendar (2 calendars found, connectivity = OK), but the app still isn’t syncing events or identifying the User ID, which blocks the core USP.

Here’s a focused summary of what's happening and what needs addressing:


---

What’s Working

Google Calendar authentication is successful.

Connection test finds calendars.

UI/UX is clean, communicates sync state, fallback logic, and user options well.


What’s Broken

User ID is missing — this likely prevents Firestore from tracking ownership of events or syncing them.

Initial sync never completes — Initial Load Complete: No, Last API Call: Never.

No events pulled or pushed — Sync counts are all 0.

Diagnostic logs show “authenticated” but session still says “Missing User ID”, meaning token handling is only partially wired up between frontend, backend, and Google.

Next Steps (Dev-Focused Fix Plan)

1. Fix User ID handling in session

Ensure ID token or OAuth token is being decoded and stored server-side after auth handshake.

Check the user.uid or sub from token payload is correctly attached to sync requests and Firestore writes.



2. Trigger and log Initial Load

Add logs to ensure that the initial calendar read is triggered and any failures are caught (e.g. scope issues, bad token refresh, permission problems).



3. Manually test listEvents() API call with token

Verify that token has the correct calendar.readonly or calendar scope and can list events via the Calendar API in server context.



4. Wire Firestore mirror layer

Ensure the mirror layer correctly:

Filters only SyncFit-created events.

Writes sync metadata (e.g. timestamp, lastModified, conflict state).




5. Add robust error states to UI

If syncing fails due to missing UID, show a specific error (e.g. "Unable to sync: missing user credentials. Please sign out and try again.").
