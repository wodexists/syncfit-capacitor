Current Issues Identified:

1. Sync Status shows "Syncing..." indefinitely

Likely root cause: a failed or stuck async call in the sync lifecycle (Firestore update, calendar API call, or both).

Missing: meaningful error state UI when sync fails or stalls.



2. 409 Scheduling Conflict ("slot just filled up")

This should be handled gracefully by auto-refreshing slot options or offering fallback choices (e.g., “View other times”).

You still end up in a "no slots available" state without guidance or next action.



3. No backup scheduling UX if today is full

Despite multi-day logic being claimed implemented, it's not reflected in the UI — it only reports failure without offering tomorrow or alternatives.

Key Recommendations:

1. Add Real-Time Sync Diagnostics

Include a visual log or collapsible detail below “Syncing...” that shows:

Last successful fetch from Google Calendar

Status of Firestore update (e.g., pending, error, conflict)

Any Google API error messages



2. Improve Fallback Logic

If today is full:

Prompt user with: “Today looks full. Want to try tomorrow or pick a new time window?”

Add a quick-picker for time horizon (e.g., "Next 2 days", "Weekend", "Next 7 days")



3. Expand Retry & Conflict Resolution

If 409 occurs, refresh availability instantly and show next best alternative without manual action.

Add lightweight deduplication or delay window to avoid race conditions with simultaneous scheduling attempts.


4. Expose Failed Test Replays or Logging

Even if tests pass in controlled environments, create a manual error replay log (UI or dev tools tab) to capture:

Timestamp of error

Failing function (e.g., scheduleWorkout())

Relevant slot info and API payload

Your Next Ask to Replit Should Be:

> “Please prioritise a diagnostic and recovery layer for Smart Scheduling. The core booking flow still fails silently or ends in dead-ends despite test coverage. I’d like to see:

Live sync logs or error feedback under ‘Syncing’

Auto-fallback to other days if today is full

Better recovery UX on 409 error

And optionally: a ‘Dev Tools’ tab to expose calendar API responses and sync state for debugging.”
